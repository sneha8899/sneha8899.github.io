        <h5>To the side is a collection of images portarying me doing things I love, both tech related and not. Below, there are
          descriptions of all of these.</h5>
        <p>A large part of my life is made up of the projects that I complete for my classes, as well as technical side projects
          that I do for fun. I'm really lukcy to have found something that genuinely makes me extremely happy. But of course, 
          there's a lot more to me than just my interests in Computer Science. I also plan on obtaining a minor in Spanish,
          and like I mentioned on my home page, that I like to be active, and this is evident in several ways in my life.</p>
        <p>First, regarding my minor: Langauges are really important to me. I grew up in a home that spoke three different 
          languages, and all three of those are a big part of my identity. By learning other languages, I think I gain valuable
          insight into the lives of other people and their culture. Also, I know what it feels like to have people not understand 
          you due to a language barrier, and I hope to never do that to someone else.</p>
        <p>Now, in terms of being active. Running is one of my favorite things to do to destress. I've ran a few 5K's, a few 10K's,
          amd I would really love to run a half and full marathon at some point in my life. Additionally, I've played soccer for as
          long as I can remember and it is one of my favorite things to do. My friends and I try to make time to go down to the 
          fields and kick the ball around whenever we can.</p>
        <p>I've also got interest in music related things. Ever since I was little, maybe  or 7, I have taken Carnatic Classical voice
          lessons. This is a type of classical Indian music. I can play several different instruments, including the piano,
          saxophone, and flute. For a while, I was considering minoring in music, but I've decided to just enjoy it when I can.</p>
