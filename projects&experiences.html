        <h3><b>Student Intern, Department of Biomedical Informatics</b></h3>
        <p>May 2018 - Present</p>
        <p>I spent my last summer researching in the Department of Biomedical Informatics at The Ohio State University. In this role,
          I worked full time in a lab group of 10 people. Over the course of my time spent here, I've worked through several different
          projects and problems.</p>
        <p>Before I could do any of this work, I had to first learn the programming languages used. This meant that I had to learn
          Python, SQL, and R, to do the data manipulation needed; so I spent the first few weeks primarily teaching myself Python. It
          was a hard experience, but I also think it was really worthwhile. That was a new experience for me, and now I feel confident 
          in my ability to learn new languages both quickly and efficiently. During the summer, I continued to learn, and eventually
          taught myself SQL, PHP, and R.</p>
        <p>My first task was to sort through several different databases and pull out the information that I needed to work with. In the
          end, I had to work with eight total databases, and I needed information about diseases, genes, and treatments. I had to keep
          all of them in order according to the database they came from. Additionally, all of this information had to be organized and
          standardized. With each set of information (disease, genes, treatments) I had to standardize it according to 
          nationally recognized databases.</p>
        <p>After I completed this, I had to combine all of the information into one large dataset. This was then organized into a few
          related tables in MySQL. Now, I am in the process of creating a website where all of this is publicly accessible. I am using
          a PHP backend to create a database-driven website. Users will be able to come to my website and query their results by any
          type of information (genes, variations, drugs, diseases) and view all related information. This will also habe a "guessing"
          setting, where the relationships shown are more indirect. This project culminated in a poster, which can be seen 
          on the side.</p>
        <p>In addition to my own use, all of the information that I parsed and the codes I used to do it had to be clear and 
          comprehensible by all other members of my lab. As the sole non-Chinese speaker, I had to really be careful in the way that I 
          coded and displayed my results.</p>
        <p>I also worked with a few other members on their projects, which involved different analyses of similar data. Again, several
          of these projects actually used the original data that I had generated. Additionally, an older member of the lab was working
          on his PhD project, which was to create a deep learning model that could help predict a specific type of cancer within a 
          person based on their gene expression data. This was an interesting project because it was really unlike anything that I had
          done before, and I had to teach myself how to work with it. This is something that I am still in the process of 
          working on.</p>
        <h3><b>The Robot Project</b></h3>
        <p>January 2018 - April 2018</p>
        <p>When I look back at the second semester of my freshman year of college, the robot project is really what comes to mind. 
          This was a semester long project to design, build, program, and compete a fully autonomous robot. There were several tasks 
          that were required to be completed (and would impact our grades), and several that were just up for bonus points. The course 
          itself consisted of two levels, with two ramps to get up and down. </p>
        <p>My team consisted of four different people, and we all had our respective strengths - some in building, some in programming,
          and some in documentation. To the side there are pictures of our robot as it went through its different designs, all the 
          way until the final. We also had to program the robot so that it could autonomously complete the course. This was done in 
          C++, and the "brain" of the robot was the FEH PROTEUS, a touchscreen microcontroller specifically created for use in Ohio
          State's Honors Engineering Program.</p>
        <p>An important aspect of this project was attention to detail. Like I said, there were several different required tasks, and
          these were scattered throughout the course. When programming the robot, we had to make sure that we could complete those
          objectives. Every task was dependent on where the robot started or ended, which meant that consistency was key. This led to
          an implementation of a PID (Proportional, Integral, Derivative) motor control function. Essentially, this function 
          accounted for any sort of drag or wheel obstruction that might occur while the robot is moving. This enabled us to have
          more consistent, accurate runs.</p>
        <h3><b>The Software Design Project</b></h3>
        <p>December 2017</p>
        <p>At the end of my first semester of college, a team of three people - myself and two others - were tasked with programming
          a game on the FEH PROTEUS. Again, the PROTEUS is a touchscreen microcontroller. This was my first real experience 
          with creating something of this magnitude, and it was also in a relatively new language to me: C++. My group decided to 
          create a version of the classic game FlappyBird.</p>
        <p>This was a challenging task for a few reasons. FlappyBird consists of several different parts: the top and bottom 
          obstacles (which move horizontally across the screen) and the bird (which moves horizontally). My group had to determine
          how we could do that efficiently. We also needed to take in user input, a tap to the screen, so that the bird could
          move up and down and so the user could select from a start menu. Finally, we had to consider difficulty and the speed of the
          game; the original sped up as time went on, and that was something that we wanted to do as well.</p>
        <p>We ended up creating several functions that could accomplish this for different objects. Both the top and bottom obstacles
          moved the same way, so we created one general Obstacle_Move function. The bird moved up and down, so we created a separate one
          for that. This is an example of the foundation of the way that I try and code. Creating multipurpose aspects makes code 
          a lot more efficient and comprehendible.</p>
